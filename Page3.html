<h1>Electrons</h1>
<p>In this portion of the website, we are going to be covering the electrons and electron cloud portion.
Electrons are also subatomic particles just like protons and neutrons.
Electrons have an electric charge unlike neutrons, but the have the opposite charge of protons.
Electrons are found in the electron cloud, which is where all of the volume of the atom is found.
In the electron cloud you will find shells, different layers of electrons, each ring has a different energy level.
Shells also can have a certain amount of electrons, the first shell can have 2 electrons, the 2nd shell can have 8 electrons, the 3rd shell can have 18 electrons, and so on... 
The essential formula to find out how many electrons can fit in a shell is 2(n*n) where n= the shell number.
The last shell are known as the valence electrons, it is also where chemical bonds happen.
