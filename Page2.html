    <h1>The Nucleus</h1>
    <p>The nucleus is the center of an atom.
It is also where the protons and neutrons are found.
The mass of the nuclues depends on the element, such as gold or silver.
We decided to do phosphorus as our element to explain how atoms work.
So the the atomic number depends on the number of protons found in that atom.
Phosphorus has an atomic number of fifteen so it has fifteen protons.</p>
<h2>Atomic Mass</h2>
<p> Another thing that is important that we must cover today is atomic mass of an atom.
Protons and neutrons both have one atomic mass unit or amu.
Electrons are so small that we don't even consider them a mass in general.
So to get the atomic mass of an atom we add up the number of protons and neutrons to get the atomic mass.
It is really that simple.
Phosphorus has an atomic mass of thirty-one atomic mass units and fifteen protons so we can subtrace the number of 
protons by the atomic mass to get the number of neutrons which is sixteen if you got the right awnser.
