    Hello Mrs.Kastners class, welcome too our website.
<p>
Today we will be talking about the atom and its major key components.
By components I mean subatomic particles, such as the proton, neutron and the electron.
There is a lot that we could talk about when it comes to atoms but we are going to keep it with mass, volume and specifacations about subatomic particles.
So without further interuption, lets get on with the presentation.
