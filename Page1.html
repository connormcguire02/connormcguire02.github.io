            <h1>The Atom</h1>
        <p>
            The atom is the basis of everything, it is the smallest particle on our Earth.
            Atoms have been a theory since ancient Greek times but it was brought back to mind in the late Eighteen hundreds.
            In Eighteen Ninty-seven Thomson discovered the electron and suggested a new model of the atom, the "Plum Pudding"model.
        
            Atoms make up everything in our world, including you.
            The atom has three subatomic particles... 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protons</li>
            <li>Neutrons</li>
            <li>Electrons</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The protons and neutrons are both found in the nucleus which is the center of the atom and is also where the mass of the atom is found.
        The other part of the atom is the electron cloud and that is where the electrons are found, it is also where the volume of the atom is found.
        We are also going to talk about charge, and neutral charged atoms which is an atom that doesn't have a charge at all.
